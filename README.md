Experimenting using Tableau for exploratory data analysis (EDA)
## About the Dataset
This dataset, "New York City Airbnb Open Data", was taken from kaggle.com. The features from the dataset that were the main focus during EDA were Price, Location, Room Type, Number of Reviews, Availability, and Minimum Nights.

###### Breakdown of each Feature

## Goals of EDA
To understand the makeup of the Airbnb market in NYC. 

###### Questions asked during EDA

1. How do renting prices compare in different locations in NYC
2. Are certain locations more likely to offer certain room types (private/single room, shared room, entire house)
3. Which locations are more popular to stay at and how does this effect the price?
